#+TITLE: Cljsh

This is an experiment in creating a Clojure library for process
scripting. We also include a Clojure REPL with a coercing reader. This
reader translates a small bash/zsh-like language to Clojure to allow
for a convenient shell-replacement.

Project maturity: very immature. I don't even use this on a full-time
basis yet. Many things are not implemented yet. There are also some
very cool features to come.
